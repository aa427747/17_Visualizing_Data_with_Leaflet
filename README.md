Homework Unit 17 | Assignment - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

The Index file is set-up for the geoJson .js, but the circles.js does similar function, but doesn't have the intial marker on it.  There is a .csv folder that can be ignored as this is from a separate project, that I didn't get pulled out before uploading the file.  

Note able to get the plates dataset to work as it was giving a access error.
